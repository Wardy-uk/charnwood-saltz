                                            Chris, Maria and Martin
                                            met on the shingle of Cley beach, just after low tide (14.30).
                                            Chris and Martin swam 100m out to the wreck of the SS Vera and
                                            attached a buoy to the mast, while Maria enjoyed the warm sun. The
                                            sea was flat calm, deceiving us into expecting a fine weekend
                                            ahead. C&amp;M headed for the campsite at Weybourne, while Martin
                                            preferred the luxury of Sherringham YHA. A pleasant meal at The
                                            Lobster in Sherringham completed the evening.

                                                Everyone met at
                                                Cley at 8.00 a.m. ready to dive just after high tide (07.52). There
                                                was a gentle in shore wind and low breaking waves. A local warden
                                                advised that we were too early for slack water, so we lazed on the
                                                shingle until overtaken by boredom. Maria and Sue tried to swim for
                                                the buoy at 9.30 but the easterly current drew them too far away
                                                and they had to return. Tim, David and Martin went in at 9.50 from
                                                a position to the west of the buoy and had more success, dropping
                                                perfectly on the wreck at about 6m. Maria and Sue reached it on a
                                                second attempt. &nbsp;Viz was 1-2m with gentle currents changing
                                                from eastwards to westwards as we dived. There was lots of
                                                metalwork to investigate, plus crabs, lobsters, stone fish, tube
                                                worms, and gardens of plumose anemones. Dave thought he saw an eel
                                                but no one believed him. Tim-the-clepto acquired a fishing weight
                                                and a small folding grapnel for his collection. After 45 min or so
                                                we recovered the buoy and drifted gently back in on the westward
                                                current towards the car park. Chris and Harrison provided shore
                                                cover and a valuable datum against the drift.

                                                We had hoped for a
                                                morning drift dive on the reef at East Runton but early inspection
                                                revealed a strong, squally inshore wind and crashing waves.
                                                Instead, we headed for Wells and a beach walk. A stroll along the
                                                broad, flat sands to the west of the town led us to the pine woods.
                                                Tim and Chris were frightened of getting their feet wet in the
                                                pools behind the beach so Dave became St Christopher and carried
                                                them over. The children (Harrison and Sue) enjoyed tree swings in
                                                the woods. An ice cream cornet on the way back to the car park
                                                rounded off a fun and surprisingly energetic club
                                                weekend.

                                            little end of season diving trip. &nbsp;There were five divers,

                                            along for the seaside experience.&nbsp; As per the weather
                                            forecast, the Saturday was pretty good, a slight swell out to sea,
                                            and good dry conditions, the weather that is as you can't really

                                            Bay. There was plenty of life, Faye and Dave found the bows, and
                                            lots more to explore. &nbsp;John, Tim and Jeff found the boilers.
                                            There were several sightings of crustacean life, but nothing big
                                            enough to eat. &nbsp;A big old conger was also seen, but it didn't
                                            stick around long enough to have its picture taken, or be filmed by
                                            Tim and John. &nbsp;The prize treasure catch was by Tim who found a
                                            really good cylinder boot. &nbsp;He decided he didn't need it, so
                                            left it for another. &nbsp;Sadly it was Jeff's!&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                            Saturday afternoon saw us in
                                            slightly rougher seas diving Englishman's Rock, just of Rhoscolyn
                                            Head. &nbsp;A mixture of kelp and rocky gulleys were home to the
                                            usual array of fish life. &nbsp;Disappointingly again there were no
                                            crabs or lobsters big enough to take for the pot, or so it seemed.
                                            &nbsp;John did in fact not only spot a good edible size lobster,
                                            but had a fight with it.&nbsp; The lobster eventually sacrificed
                                            one of his claws and made a not so clean getaway. &nbsp;The fight
                                            was a draw.
                                        </p>

                                            Sunday's forecast was not so good,
                                            so it was shore diving in the sheltered areas of Trearddur Bay.
                                            &nbsp;We didn't get that deep, but there was a mixture of stuff to
                                            explore and look at. &nbsp;We were all experienced divers, but it
                                            would have made a great site and dive for a trainee diver,
                                            especially as the access was pretty easy. &nbsp;All in all another
                                            good dive, and we all enjoyed it.&nbsp; Following the infamous or
                                            famous Anglesey weekend of 2012, when all diving was completely
                                            blown out, this was our first proper full weekend of diving off the
                                            island, and went down pretty well. &nbsp;Thanks to the
                                            skipper,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sbsribcharter.co.uk/about.html">Aubrey Diggle</a>, for
                                            his big boat, his helpful skippering, and his laid back and
                                            friendly attitude to us divers.&nbsp; P.S. &nbsp;Anyone diving
                                            ''The Missouri'' this season, please look out for John's weight
                                            belt. &nbsp;It somehow ended up on the bottom as he was getting
                                            back into the RIB. &nbsp;

                                            On 13th January I organised a
                                            Christmas meal for us all at the Laughing Buddha in
                                            Loughborough.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd received 22
                                            responses to the email I sent out for the meal and was very
                                            surprised that all 22 turned up. The booking was made for 7.30pm
                                            and we all started with drinks and proceeded to get updates from
                                            one and all. This was especially significant for one of our members
                                            who had had a serious health issue before Christmas which we were
                                            all relieved to hear was not as bad as we all thought. Then it was
                                            onto the buffet and general chatting between all (round tables so
                                            much better for group conversations) the restaurant staff were very
                                            good, as soon as you'd finished a dish the plates were taken away
                                            ready for the next dish. All the dishes were superb and we would
                                            definitely book again. At the end of the night it was discussed
                                            that we should have a go at guess Faye's baby's weight before
                                            everyone settled up their bill and left for home. All in all a good
                                            night had by all... I hope !!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John

                                                        As part of their 60th year, BSAC
                                                        suggested that local clubs might like to organise events to
                                                        celebrate the 60th anniversary of the British Sub-Aqua Club’s
                                                        formation. Delmar Diving Club (Wigston) had an idea to attempt to
                                                        take the World Record for underwater dominoes (which currently
                                                        stands at 48) and, as they do not have 60 divers, they sent out an
                                                        email to clubs far and wide &nbsp;inviting members to take part in
                                                        the event. What could be simpler than a game of dominoes? Sue &amp;
                                                        Tim received the email from Delmar and circulated it to Charnwood
                                                        Saltz members, and I thought that it might be quite novel to take
                                                        part in the attempt and perhaps become a World Record holder in the
                                                        process (to be right up there with the worlds other dedicated
                                                        athletic types). I was up for it and decided to try and encourage
                                                        other club members to have-a-dabble after all it would be a bit of
                                                        fun and something different to our normal activities. After finding
                                                        out more information from Delmar, I was able to inform members of
                                                        how the event would unfold, and gradually more members took an

                                                        to help manage the attempt, and no-one was going to get in or out
                                                        of the pool area with such a formidable duo on the doors unless
                                                        they were supposed too!! I was told that there would be media
                                                        interest &nbsp;generated by the event, and we were invited to bring
                                                        along club banners and display them if we had one. After consulting
                                                        with Sue, it became apparent that we did not have one so I set to

                                                        providing a rather magnificent 8 x 2 banner bearing the clubs name,
                                                        contact details and two rather natty looking divers! Result!

                                                        Armed with the new banner, hammer,
                                                        masonry nails, string and a Stanley knife (other kinds of knife are
                                                        available) we made our way to Wigston Pool and I was very eager to
                                                        stake our claim to a piece of the building wall (as close to the
                                                        main entrance as I could) to make sure that we were noticed.
                                                        Unfortunately, my enthusiasm was severely diluted when I was
                                                        informed by the organisers that the mortar police would not allow
                                                        us to attach anything to the building hmmmmmm, what now? The only
                                                        place that I could display the banner was on the car park fence,
                                                        not ideal, but it was up and visible (it had presence and it looked
                                                        lovely).&nbsp; When the other Saltz had arrived and we all stood
                                                        chatting after registering (and eating free pizza sponsored by
                                                        Domino’s Pizza of course who else?) the official photographer was
                                                        taking photographs of the participants, and it was hurriedly
                                                        decided to take the banner from the fence and hold it out proudly
                                                        in front of the team as we posed for our team photo. Excellent idea
                                                        and then we rather cheekily kept it unfurled in the background as
                                                        the organiser was being interviewed by a BBC camera crew, good

                                                        given by Delmar Club officials, everyone started to get their kit

                                                        free pizza to while away the time as we could not have access to
                                                        the pool until 8.30. The Mayor of Wigston welcomed us all to the
                                                        event and wished us luck, and then we moved into teams of four
                                                        ready to get it on! The event was to be independently witnessed by

                                                        up. There were cameras below the water line to record what we were
                                                        doing and verify that we were in fact playing dominoes as set down
                                                        in the rules, and there were snorkelers swimming around keeping an
                                                        eye on us too. It was all very well adjudicated what could go

                                                        together and waited! When the first Klaxon sounded, it signalled
                                                        the start of the ten-minutes and we were able to shuffle the
                                                        dominoes and start playing the game. We had to make sure that our
                                                        movements were slow and steady so as not to cause any rapid water
                                                        movement that could disperse the dominoes as they were laid on the
                                                        bottom of the pool, and we eventually finished two complete games
                                                        by the time ten minutes had passed. However, to satisfy the
                                                        criteria, we all had to finish the game that we were playing (and
                                                        sit, or kneel with our arms folded, to signal to the snorkelers
                                                        that we had finished) before being able to surface together.
                                                        Eventually we were given the thumbs-up to surface and the watching
                                                        crowd on the balcony clapped and cheered as we came up we had done
                                                        it! What a laugh, we are all potential World Record holders,
                                                        ooooohh matron how very novel! We made our way out of the pool,
                                                        de-kitted and changed and the evening all but over.&nbsp;

                                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                                        The mood was very quiet as people
                                                        dispersed, it had been a long evening and some had a long drive
                                                        home, so there was no time for a formal thanks for coming and well
                                                        done back-patting address from the organisers, and I don’t think
                                                        that there was really much appetite for that from the participants
                                                        either! It was a good experience to be part of the World Record
                                                        attempt with other Saltz members, and divers from other clubs, and
                                                        we all have to wait now to see if the information submitted by
                                                        Delmar to Guinness will be enough to be awarded the World Record.
                                                        Fingers crossed eh? Talking of records if Sue, Tim &amp; Zak become
                                                        World record holders (an entire family of world Record holders)
                                                        would it be worth contacting Guinness about that one for another
                                                        day eh? Andy P.<br />

                                                        storms of an unduly poor Spring. We stayed at Annstead Farm

                                                        weekend and we dived in bright sun and flat seas. Early starts each

                                                        Harker (18m) and the Chris Cristensen Propeller (20m), and on

                                                        dreadful vis (1-2m; perhaps slightly more on Sunday afternoon) but
                                                        there was fun and interest to be had poking around in rock crevices
                                                        and amongst wreckage. The strong currents around the islands, on
                                                        spring tides, made it easy to miss targets or get stuck in rocky,
                                                        seal-infested lagoons, but the skipper’s guidance was reliable and
                                                        we made the most of the unpromising conditions.&nbsp;

                                                        one well for such experiences. According to Luka, the Christensen
