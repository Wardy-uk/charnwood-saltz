                                                        Starting with the easy ones (!) “When was BSAC formed?” the quiz
                                                        covered a large range of topics at all levels. Inspired by our
                                                        newest member, Zak, some of the questions were not the normal ones
                                                        for a pub quiz. Topics from James Bond to name those Meerkats kept
                                                        everyone on their toes.&nbsp; Congratulations to “Lord of the

                                                        wooden spoon but the opportunity to set the next

                                                        When we did finally dive on the Sunday we had all sorts of
                                                        things go awry.&nbsp; On the first dive at The Craige Martin lost
                                                        his weight belt and Lynne’s HP hose broke. &nbsp;&nbsp;On the
                                                        second dive at West Hurker Jeff’s mask strap snapped. For those who
                                                        did dive it was fantastic with Martyn and Sue seeing the biggest
                                                        lobster ever. Unfortunately they had to leave it in the water as
                                                        this is a marine reserve so there was no evidence to show! Even
                                                        though we were unable to dive both days it has not affected our
                                                        enthusiasm for St. Abbs &amp; we have booked to come again next

                                                        got to do with an Egyptian diving holiday?&nbsp;

                                                        Well hang on to your regulators and read on. A little history to
                                                        begin. I attended our Dive Club’s AGM where I was pleased to be
                                                        presented with a certificate for being a fully paid up member who
                                                        had not dived for the whole year (well some of us have to work)!
                                                        Shortly after, Maria and I received details of a club diving
                                                        holiday in Egypt, my wife kindly pointed out that we should go, she
                                                        being a serial holiday goer. Well OK, she is on the internet on a
                                                        daily basis looking for them, but back to the story. Feeling a
                                                        little guilty I thought she was right - OK I
                                                        relented!&nbsp;<br />

                                                        The bookings duly took place, Mark being the kind of guy he is,
                                                        sorted out the whole holiday for the club members. It was looking
                                                        at one stage as if we would be going without payment, but alas, he
                                                        remembered, so we paid up and off we went.&nbsp;

                                                        Well as those of you without Alzheimer's will recall there was a
                                                        volcano in Iceland whose ash was visiting our shores, so it was
                                                        plan B by the tour operator, off to Birmingham to get the plane
                                                        from there, only to find out that the volcanic ash can travel
                                                        faster than the bus. &nbsp;What did this mean? Yes you’ve got it,
                                                        the potential for another non diving certificate! Back home to
                                                        enjoy my annual leave in England.&nbsp;

                                                    <p>Egypt II - A Dive Holiday. &nbsp;The Rerun.&nbsp;</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Have we been here before I ask myself? Yes - but this time we
                                                        got to EMA and the aircraft actually took off arriving safely in
                                                        Egypt. &nbsp;Maybe now there was a chance of no certificate this
                                                        year? &nbsp;All the club members were in good spirits (no that sort
                                                        came later), so off to the hotel on the bus. &nbsp;Looking good so
                                                        far! After a good night’s rest we had an early pick-up from the
                                                        hotel and kit in hand, it was off to the diving centre.
                                                        &nbsp;Booking in was painless, showing our qualifications and
                                                        convincing them that we had all seen water before. &nbsp;I was a
                                                        little apprehensive as I never like this part, but I was well
                                                        looked after by those who had done this sort of thing before, so
                                                        feeling a lot better when it was all sorted, it was kit to the
                                                        boat.&nbsp;

                                                            There were lots of them jostling in the water picking up
                                                            those who had paid. &nbsp;But which was ours? We finally identified
                                                            the Sea Flower, which was the boat we had been allocated, it looked
                                                            great. &nbsp;So, kit on the boat and into the storage holds, up to
                                                            the sun-deck and out to sea.&nbsp; I had done very little diving
                                                            from a boat and was not too sure how rough it was going to be (the
                                                            last boat dive I had done was a little choppy to say the least),
                                                            but on arrival at the dive site I was pleased to see it was very
                                                            calm. &nbsp;We then buddied up, those of us inexperience buddying
                                                            with the more experienced club members to get more confidence and
                                                            for safety of course, the others well they had done it loads
                                                            anyway, checks done and into the water. &nbsp; &nbsp;

                                                            The clarity of the Red Sea was great, well worth the trip
                                                            and a final goodbye to that none diver qualification as I started
                                                            to submerge. &nbsp;Bit of a problem with the buoyancy but getting
                                                            there, a few OKs to my buddy at the bottom and away we go, fish
                                                            were great and not worth me describing as there was far too much
                                                            and it was too good to describe (see photos courtesy of Mark). The
                                                            one thing I would say is that the Red Sea lives up to its name, I
                                                            will have to come back here, and that’s on my first dive. &nbsp;The
                                                            end of the dive came too quickly, but getting back on the boat
                                                            there was an air of excitement as we regaled to the others of our
                                                            short adventures and of course debriefed the dive in preparation
                                                            for the afternoon.

                                                            fish, coral and how much air they had left, the norm I guess.
                                                            &nbsp;Off to the doctor for me, confirmed the worst, perforated
                                                            eardrum, telling me not to dive and get it checked out at home.

                                                        Not depressed, we went to the boat for the 2nd day, helped with
                                                        the kit and determined to get some photos for the album instead of
                                                        diving. &nbsp;We set off again to a new place to dive, the water
                                                        looked very inviting, but alas Harry Potter’s wand was not at hand.
                                                        &nbsp;So camera at the ready I got some good shots of the team
                                                        kitting up, be good to look back on in years to come. &nbsp;When
                                                        the last diver submerged I was left to contemplate what diving was
                                                        like and checking through the photos I had taken, I was quite
                                                        pleased I had captured some of the excitement of the dive, and
                                                        looked forward to their return for more good shots.&nbsp;

                                                            relatively good, well at least better than my diving skills I
                                                            thought. Some good stories again, large fish, small ones even the
                                                            mention of a shark, in your dreams! &nbsp;Lunch and back into the
                                                            water this time at the next dive site. If I am not careful this
                                                            will get repetitive!&nbsp;

                                                            partly because we had stayed in a cheap all inclusive and they
                                                            served drinks in really small sizes, so getting drunk was out of
                                                            the question, for diving purposes as well of course, but the food
                                                            was reasonable and in good quantity. The days that followed were
                                                            largely the same but with different dive sites and differing skill,
                                                            all made me decide I would be on the next trip out here.

                                                        training for a good safe dive. The moral of the holiday really had

                                            Well 4 of us headed of on a Friday night down to Swansea for a
                                            weekend on the rya power boating level 2 course, The course had
                                            been arrange with the Cwmtawe BSAC club and was being run by John
                                            Morgan, The 1st day was all classroom based and when through the
                                            basic aspect of boat handing, safety and chart work. After a day in
                                            the classroom everyone was looking forward to the 2nd day getting
                                            out on the ribs after a go on the controls we started with the
                                            import things like man over board drills, mooring the boat and 3
                                            point turns as well as high speed u turns and figure of 8 turns.
                                            Apart from a couple of near misses for a certain someone who will
                                            remain nameless everyone passed the course and now can’t wait to
                                            get the club boat back on the water. Big thanks to Pete for
                                            arranging to course and thanks to John and the rest of the people

                                                        put my new skills into practice, and venture some 20+ miles out
                                                        from Littlehampton to dive three fantastic wrecks over three
                                                        days.&nbsp;

                                                    <p>
                                                        Someone aboard had brought the weather with them, which made the
                                                        two hour journey out to the Moldavia an almost tropical experience.
                                                        It also gave me plenty of time to get to know my buddy with whom I
                                                        would dive with for the next few days. His calm manner and
                                                        readiness to pass on his knowledge put me a ease which was what I
                                                        needed before commencing my first 50m dive at sea. New boat, new
                                                        people, new dive site and pushing my skills further put me back in
                                                        touch with the feelings we've all felt in our early days of diving.
                                                        A very humbling experience. The shot line was in place the trapeze
                                                        fastened and dropped over board - it was time to go. To my suprise
                                                        the vis was some 15m which helped me settle into the dive nicely.
                                                        At 30m the wreck came into view; the bow section rose from the sea
                                                        bed just as I'd seen in the books I'd read. Lying on her port side
                                                        guns swung to the sea bed, I knew that the 30 mins bottom time was
                                                        never going to be enough, just a mear snap shot. Finning around the
                                                        bow the trawlers nets snagged and lost to the wreck look as though
                                                        they belonged.&nbsp; Heading towards the midships the deck winches
                                                        were all there, the six inch guns and port holes were still in
                                                        place, and the abundance of fish life&nbsp; made &nbsp;this a
                                                        fantastic first deep wreck dive for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 45 minute
                                                        ascent time was worth every minute and once on board the smile
                                                        wouldn't go away. &nbsp;

                                                    <p>
                                                        With my nerves settled and a good night’s sleep I couldn’t wait
                                                        to dive the Mexico. Just as I thought it coudn't get any better I
                                                        was met with the most amazing site. Once again 15m vis and the
                                                        wreck was almost moving with the amount life on her; Congers were
                                                        poking out the starboard side; Ling and Conger were freely swimming
                                                        inside the bow section; and no sooner had we left the shot line
                                                        than it was lost behind the shoal of fish that closed in behind us.
                                                        Lobster and Crabs of make believe sizes and oh I nearly forgot the
                                                        wreck. We finned down into her holds and out the damaged port side
                                                        to find the rudder were the ascent onto the gunnels took us back to
                                                        the shot. Mind blowing and worth every second on that
                                                        trapeze.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it was on the street you wouldn’t look
                                                        twice at the Duke but at 50m it makes its cargo of china, glass
                                                        candle holders, tumblers, oil lamps and tableware treasure. I was
                                                        determined to have a good look at the wreck and not hunt for tat.
                                                        Did I manage it? What do you think... I sit here writing this
                                                        looking at a candle holder and shot glass that has spent the last
                                                        110 years on the channel floor until it became my treasure (and
                                                        Faye’s tat!).&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                                        Apart from the mind blowing diving, I came away with the
                                                        realisation that if you relax, relax and relax, have faith in the
                                                        skills you have and relax some more, then the enjoyment of diving
                                                        will look after itself.

                                                        crossed we made the journey to Swanage to meet our Welsh friends
                                                        and indulge in some of the wrecks the area has to

                                                        flat sea and bright skies so before we knew it we were descending

                                                        perfect introduction to wreck diving for the guys who had come

                                                        learnt over the long winter months. A 32% mix gave us a nice long

                                                        With the weather picking up quickly it was a close call whether
                                                        or not we made the dive on the Betsey Anne, the decision was made
                                                        and at 24meters we was greeted with 7/8meters vis and for me the
                                                        first time I had dived this wreck the hour spent on it was
                                                        fantastic. Plenty to see for everyone from the wreck lover to the
                                                        fish spotter. Once you located the boilers with its family of
                                                        congers inside it was a breeze to navigate around meaning a relaxed
                                                        time was spent under water. Once on board Sidewinder the fun seemed
                                                        to come to a stand still for some with a force 6 now blowing the

                                                        on Thursday night with the news that we had been blown out so a
                                                        quick bit of re-planning by Leigh and Teignmouth it was, so after a
                                                        good drive down and a not to bad night camping we set about getting
                                                        the club boat ready for the water the first time &nbsp;in a couple
                                                        of years. Everything seemed to go well on our first run out myself
                                                        and Dave having chance to get used to the boat under the

                                                        So with a few hours running and testing of things we went about
                                                        getting ready for a dive which turned out to be a five minute dip
                                                        to 5 meters but the viz was so bad we canned the dive and instead
                                                        had a bit more fun on the boat. With a good day on the boat on the
                                                        Saturday we were hoping for the same and abit more diving on the
                                                        Sunday and possible a few edibles, so we head of for ores rock for
                                                        a mid-morning dive and the viz was a lot better in the region of
                                                        6-7 meters and plenty of crabs to try and bag, this ended up being
                                                        are only dive of the weekend but was well worth the trip.&nbsp;

                                                        When asked in January, on a cold Wednesday night, about the
                                                        preferred accommodation for a diving trip in Scotland in May (which
                                                        seemed all too close, and therefore probably would still be cold!),
                                                        it is only understandable that people with less hardy skins might
                                                        take the offer of a cottage complete with proper beds, albeit
                                                        shared rooms, over the lure of any campsite. For a reasonable fee
                                                        these less hardy types enjoyed an incredible luxury: being able to
                                                        roll out of bed and straight into the dive boat at our Skipper’s

                                                        Those of us camping had the arduous 5 minute car journey to cope
                                                        with! So as you can probably tell: nothing was going to be
                                                        stressful this weekend- provided the weather kept its end of the
                                                        bargain! I don’t know who he paid, or what kind of rain dance he
                                                        did, but in organising this trip Jeff had obviously inadvertently
                                                        charmed the weather Gods, as nothing but hot, hot sunshine rained
                                                        down onto our now slightly pink skins all weekend! That was that.
                                                        Weather? Check. Accommodation? Check. Great news so far and all
                                                        that remained now was the actual reason we had travelled this

                                                        the watchful eye of an old black Labrador, we carted our gear along
                                                        the harbour wall and began the process of loading the boat for the
                                                        first time. Jokes were passed around older, more experienced divers
                                                        and the novices were trying to remember if they had left anything
                                                        behind that they would need later. I know I must have looked
                                                        somewhat nervous as Sue was taking great care to make sure I was
                                                        comfortable. The boat boarded, dry-suits zipped up and kit donned,
                                                        only the water beckoned. And by now, we needed to be cooled down!
                                                        The sea like a mill pond and the adrenaline now kicking in, it all
                                                        seemed so natural to, roll into the sea for the first
                                                        time!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                                    <p>
                                                        Descending into the water, feeling the now slightly familiar
                                                        feeling of the water compressing your suit and staring your buddy
                                                        in the eyes as you descend, waiting for the bottom to approach, you
                                                        became more at ease and comfortable in your surroundings. Not cold.
                                                        Not boiling. Not a racing current. Lovely, Relaxing, Idyllic.
                                                        Perhaps not idyllic, but dropping down on our first shallow dive
                                                        (12m) we were greeted in an undulating sea bed and more sea life
                                                        than you could shake a stick at! If you saw it that is! I spent all
                                                        my time being quite surprised I was still alive underwater, whilst
                                                        Sue was pointing out all sorts of marine life such as Lobsters,
                                                        massive crabs, Starfish, a few more crabs and a couple of Wrasse
                                                        sailed passed us quite unaware that we shouldn’t be there! And then
                                                        it was over. Just as I began to feel accustomed to this alien world
                                                        and had started looking for life of my own, it was time to surface.
                                                        Who would believe it!?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p><br /></p>

                                                        The second dive of the day. Following a brief chat of what we
                                                        had seen during the previous dive and a refill of the dive
                                                        cylinder, we were soon back underwater again, gazing under rocks
                                                        and almost always finding a crustacean of some description. There
                                                        were soft corals everywhere, Dead Mans’ Fingers on every outcrop of
                                                        rock and loads of hermit crabs scuttling across the bottom as the
                                                        ‘big people’ approached. Again, one or two Wrasse were seen
                                                        effortlessly breathing underwater watching us mockingly. There were
                                                        a few lobster pots harbouring our edible red friends inside them
                                                        but what really surprised me was the size of them. Their size and
                                                        their stupidity. Apparently, although I don’t know from experience,
                                                        if you shine a light on a lobster anywhere else other than in a
                                                        protected area, it will retreat into its crevice until you have
                                                        passed. But not here. These lobsters must know that they are
                                                        protected. If you shone a torch on any of these lobsters you were
                                                        rewarded with the thing coming to get you! Perhaps as your penance
                                                        for disturbing its peace and quiet. If only it were somewhere
                                                        else... oh well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                                        This time, on the way back from the dive site, we were greeted
                                                        on the surface by a small family of dolphins, who were admiring the
                                                        boat from a distance. This was for me at least, the highlight of
                                                        the trip. Sitting on the boat, coffee and biscuit in hand, watching
                                                        a mammal that could actually do what I had just been trying to do,
                                                        and making it look so graceful.&nbsp;&nbsp; The abundance of sea
                                                        life was to be a theme throughout the weekend’s diving. However, in
                                                        no one place had I ever seen so great a number of Soft Corals as in
                                                        Anemone Alley. The place was packed with all manner of sea life
                                                        such as Urchins, Brittle Stars and Dead mans’ Fingers, the latter
                                                        of which covered every available inch. I’m not exaggerating when I
                                                        say that wherever there was not a piece of anchored life, there was
                                                        no rock to anchor to! The place was teeming with colours. Purples,
                                                        blues, pinks, white and oranges. It all made me very wary of what
                                                        my fins were doing! As it was so calm and relaxing and due to the
                                                        ease with which life was spotted at this site, we dived it twice.
                                                        Well, if the first time had been good, the second time was
                                                        sensational. The flat fish and butterfish which were plentiful (not
                                                        unique to this dive site), were blown away by the sheer number of
                                                        Nudibranches! From tiny, to slightly less tiny, to actually quite
                                                        respectable; they were seen everywhere during the second dive at
                                                        this site. I remember clearly how Nudies are an elusive critter on
                                                        a UK dive, but there it is. Not just one, but loads of the things.
                                                        Incredible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                                    <p>
                                                        To discuss every dive I feel would be unjust as I think it would
                                                        detract from overall experience. And that aside, I can’t really
                                                        remember what happened anyway. One thing to take note of though:
                                                        not one dive was a disappointment and provided the weather is as
                                                        grand as this time I would most definitely go again.&nbsp;&nbsp; So
                                                        here are my thanks for Jeff for organising a brilliant trip and to
                                                        everybody at the club who provided such great company for the
                                                        weekend. I will blame you all when my bank balance takes a drop, as
                                                        I have definitely gotten the diving bug! A fantastic trip.

                                            difference a few hours of moonlight can make, early Saturday
                                            morning we arose to a glorious almost summers day and we were to be
                                            blessed by the weather for the remainder of the

                                            With a heavy swell, head into the wind and the sun on our back
                                            we beat our way out to the HMS Scylla for our fist sea dive of the
                                            season. Four divers decended onto the wreck, greeted by some 10
                                            meters of visibilty they finned off in their buddy pairs to enjoy a
                                            fantastic 50 minutes on what is now fast becoming a wreck that
                                            belongs to the sea. With Dead Man’s Fingers and Plumose Anemomes
                                            carpeting her sides and Pollock patroling her decks, the cheecky

                                            James Egan Layne. This wreck never fails to please any diver who
                                            visits her and fins along the almost Jurassic shell that she has
                                            become. With the cargo fully exposed and an abundance of marine
                                            life at a nice shallow depth there wasn't a dull moment within the
                                            hour submerged alongside the wreck.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday saw flat
                                            calm seas with no wind and excellent vis and with a seasoned
                                            skipper coming along as a ''guest'' with a wealth of knowledge on
                                            our destination what could go wrong... maybe someone moved the
                                            Persia the day we arrived but it certainly didn't lie Westward of
                                            our entry point. Never mind after 5mins of looking the three divers
                                            in the water gave up hope directed some unseen before diving
                                            signals at the surface cover and happily finned around for a lovely
                                            scenic dive. Cuckoo Wrasse, Squat lobsters, Velvet and Edible
                                            Crabs, Soft Corals and Anemones amongst others all adorned the sea
                                            bed to make missing the wreck bearable not that we let in known as
                                            we surfaced.&nbsp;

                                            Our first weekend at the coast this year passed in a flash, with
                                            a belly full of the finest cuisine and the company we hooked up the
                                            rib and headed the bonnet north for the long journey home, or was
                                            it west! Let’s hope the weather continues and last season can be
                                            put to rights with more trips like this one.&nbsp;

                                            Well let me say (on behalf of everyone) a big thanks to Pete for
                                            arranging this event and picking such a knowledgeable instructor.
                                            The weekend started with a day of lectures round Tim and Sue's from
                                            our instructor Jack Ingle who has a great knowledge of diving and
                                            his knowledge of nitrox is second to none as he wrote the book!!!!
                                            After mastering the nitrox tables and understanding the new risk
                                            and benefit it can bring to diving everyone passed the theory
                                            paper. Our mammoth day of lectures over we were ready for the
                                            cove.', 'We were all set for a couple of dives on Sunday at a cold
                                            Stoney, and it was fairly clear from the start of the day that it
                                            would not be just a nitrox course. Both Jack and Andy wanted to
                                            pass on plenty of little tips and trick from their vast diving
                                            experience which was well received by all.&nbsp; The plan for the
                                            1st dive was down to 20m and then do a few skill at 6m. The buddy
                                            teams were Jack, Faye, Dave &amp; John, leaving me with Andy, Sue
                                            &amp; Tim. After an initial weight check we started, which was ok
                                            apart from the cold water. After about 30mins of swimming along we
                                            did a few skills from regulator swapping to hovering at 5m and
                                            putting up a DSMB unaided but I for one was happy when we signalled
                                            to go up as it was starting to get cold. We then all made sure that
                                            we had plenty of hot drinks and a good debrief which included a few
                                            more tweaks to our kit and loads to Sue's!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                                            second dive was shorter and we switched instructor, it was good to
                                            see a few other ways to perform different task and improve on what
                                            we had done in the first dive.&nbsp;&nbsp; I personal would like to
                                            thanks Jack and Andy for a good days diving and in helping make me
                                            think about different ways to do things. It was good news that
                                            everyone passed the course and took a lot away from it, this was a
                                            lot more than just a nitrox course and I would highly recommend it
                                            to anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark Croson

                                                        The first dive on Saturday was at Petticowick, just around the
                                                        St Abbs headland from the harbour. A particular highlight was that
                                                        this was John Branston’s first sea dive, accompanied by Graham.
                                                        Lots of large Sunstars spotted, as well as a lobster sheltering in
                                                        the rocks. After a break back on shore we dived at Black Carrs.
                                                        Again lots of wildlife, particularly the carpets of Brittlestars,
                                                        clinging together for mutual support in the current. It was
                                                        noticeable that there was quite a swell as we exited the water
                                                        after this dive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                                        We had planned a shore dive to Cathedral Rock as the third dive
                                                        of the day, but unfortunately the writing was literally on the
                                                        wall. The harbourmaster had placed a sign stopping access to the
                                                        harbour walls due to unsafe conditions.&nbsp;

                                                    <p>
                                                        Next day we assembled at the harbour but the conditions did not
                                                        look promising. Paul Crow advised that conditions were unsuitable
                                                        and were forecast to be worse next day. There were no shore diving
                                                        sites offering shelter from the wind. The shipping forecast quoted
                                                        onshore winds, force 5 - 6, occasionally 7. So it was time for
                                                        plans A, B and C. John and family set off for home, Phil and Alison
                                                        visited Edinburgh and Graham and Jeff did a longer walk in the St
                                                        Abbs Head area. Spectacular views were everywhere, and we may have
                                                        spotted an interesting dive site for the next

                                            With expectations running high for some reasonable weather (most
                                            of this year’s dives were marred by poor weather), we arrived on
                                            Beadnell &nbsp;car park early on Friday afternoon to walk out onto
                                            a still sunny beach &nbsp;with a sea that resembled a shimmering
                                            sheet of glass. I remarked that it would have been pleasant to have
                                            gone for a swim, which for some reason was treated with derision by
                                            Mark?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                            Accommodation was at the bunkhouse in Beadnell close to the
                                            amenities (2 pubs). It was clean and warm with en-suite, with
                                            parking outside the door and above all very reasonably priced .The
                                            price included a full English breakfast (a two minute walk down the
                                            road), accompanied by many tales of interest by our old sea dog
                                            host, Stan Hall. The diving, around the Outer farn islands is as
                                            spectacular&nbsp; as you will get anywhere around the British
                                            Isles, but only if you can get good weather favourable tides and a
                                            know legible skipper. This weekend was one of those memorable ones,
                                            where everything dropped into place. We were all up early the
                                            following morning to catch slack water, and 8.20am, found us all
                                            breakfasted, kitted up and out on the water. The dive boat very
                                            aptly named Moby(check out the website). could only be described as
                                            a hybrid &nbsp;hard boat/Rib, with the best attributes of both.
                                            With 8 divers, a skipper, tanks for two dives, and all ancillary
                                            gear we were soon plaining at a nice steady 25-30 mph (no
                                            kidding)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                            Dive 1: The Hopper Seals everywhere! It was like dipping your
                                            feet in gravy and then trying to walk through a yard full of
                                            puppies. Very amusing if you were the one without gravy on your
                                            feet. Shear walls down to 25 metres with plenty of sea life. We
                                            found our lamps very helpful in the dark foreboding&nbsp; gullies.
                                            Note for future divers, please keep your eyes peeled on the seaward
                                            side of the last deep gully at the end of this dive at about 20+
                                            metres, my 40W LED. Dive lamp went over the side whilst de-kiting
                                            by the boat .a crisp crunchy 20 awaits the

                                            Dive 2: The Abyssinia again vis upwards of 8mtrs with lots to
                                            see. Sun stars brittle stars corrals urchins crabs lobsters and
                                            some particularly friendly ballan wrasse who showed no fear
                                            whatsoever when taking sea urchin from my fingers Between dives,
                                            because of the very quiet sea the seal songs were very loud and
                                            clear and I was put in mind of the old sea tails of sailors being
                                            lured onto the rocks by singing mermaids (seals) All I can say on
                                            that one is they must have been hard up, or it was grab a granny
                                            night.&nbsp;&nbsp; With having such an early start, and an
                                            afternoon spare some of our number felt fit enough to embark upon a
                                            six mile route march in the afternoon, whilst myself and Mark, (not
                                            wanting to show anybody up) spent an exhausting 3 hours dragging
                                            ourselves up and around Bamburgh Castle. Must remember to take
                                            binoculars next time the views over the Farne Islands are
                                            wonderful.

                                            Dive 3: Whirl Rocks This dive is on the outermost Farnes, and to
                                            the experienced diver you can feel the hairs on the back of your
                                            neck prickle when you imagine the power of the sea in this place at
                                            any time other than slack water. A 15 metre sheer rock face
                                            straight down on to a steel littered bottom give some idea of the
                                            havoc wreaked by this swirling turbulent sea. Many
                                            lobsterpots(Ghost pots) ripped from their moorings lay scattered
                                            around with long shredded lines. We released a couple of young
                                            lobsters from some of these pots but time was against us and other
                                            small lobsters didn’t appreciate our efforts (watch your fingers!)
                                            so we continued on to look at a huge ships rudder section. &nbsp;An
                                            unforgettable dive.

                                            Dive 4: Back on the Knifestone. No I didn’t find my lamp!! We
                                            again got on the large ships prop and this time found the greater
                                            part of the wreck. Many lobsters and interesting sea life and I am
                                            hoping that Marks first attempt with his camera will turn out as
                                            well as the weekend! Again a highly interesting and enjoyable dive.
                                            The days early start was a blessing because 2.30 p.m. found us back
                                            on the big road south. We hit a hold up of about 45 minutes, but
                                            then what would you expect? The gods have to exact some small price
                                            for such a memorable diving weekend !&nbsp;

                                            Eight divers enjoyed a fantastic weekend in Plymouth. With
                                            everyone eager to go we set off in the club boat around Pen Lee
                                            Point and Rame Head to join every other diver in the area on the
                                            Scylla.&nbsp; On descending to the deck it was good to see that the
                                            amount of life on this purpose - sunk wreck has steadily increased
                                            since our last visit here two years ago. Lots of Plumose Anemone
                                            and Dead Man’s Fingers covering the starboard side has started to
                                            give the Scylla something I thought it lacked on my previous dive
                                            here, character and atmosphere. Finning around the bow gave us a
                                            good opportunity to put her size into perspective, as we looked up
                                            at the outline of her sharp bow you couldn't help but be impressed
                                            by the Scylla's enormity. Once back on the deck there's plenty to
                                            explore, with all the doors and windows open. It's good fun poking
                                            around in what was once a place of work for hundreds. The time to
                                            leave the wreck and ascend to the surface came all too soon for
                                            myself, but at least I got to dive the Scylla. There's a rumour
                                            that two of our more advanced divers missed it altogether. Maybe
                                            they preferred the sandy bottom? So with all safely aboard we made
                                            the wet journey back to Mountbatten for lunch and to poke some fun
                                            at the two unnamed divers with lack of compass skills. Even the
                                            best get it wrong sometimes!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                            The James Eagan Layne was the next dive and as always well worth
                                            the visit. Everyone on board enjoyed a good dive on the old liberty
                                            ship, although the vis could have been a little kinder to us. When
                                            descending onto the bow of the wreck you can't help but smile at
                                            her. Full of life, her bow still reaches up from the sand to the
                                            surface. The decks which have been eroded by the sea opening up the
                                            inside of this impressive ship to all kinds of life forms, making
                                            for interesting diving by carefully finning in and out of the
                                            skeleton - like structure. After finning around and over the wreck,
                                            and with 45 minutes on the clock, it was time to ascend the bow
                                            shot line and head for home. Sunday was something else, with force
                                            5 - 6 winds the decision was made to head for the relative shelter
                                            of the breakwater. With three divers down and two left on the boat
                                            the weather decided to give us a run for our money. Within 40
                                            minutes we had a force 7 coming straight at us and three divers to
                                            get back on the boat was going to be no fun.&nbsp;

                                            Did we manage? Of course! With a long, wet white - knuckle ride
                                            back to the slip it wasn't a hard decision to cancel all diving
                                            plans and head for the pub for a well - earned pint, hearty meal
                                            and to enjoy some good company for the evening.&nbsp;

                                        <p>A great weekend organised by Graham Brookes!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Due to illness, just a small group of 3 divers set off to St
                                            Abbs. Having watched the feature on diving Cathedral Rock on BBC's
                                            Coast programme the previous week I was keen to be there, so keen
                                            that when packing the car to leave on Thursday I left my drysuit
                                            behind! Accommodation for the weekend was the excellent <a href="http://www.rhovanion.org">Rhovanion B&amp;B</a> in Coldingham,
                                            just 1.5 miles from St Abbs. Lynne reckoned that after a Rhovanion
                                            breakfast you could take a weight off your weight-belt. I don't
                                            know if it was excellent research by Graham in advance, or just
                                            good luck, but it turned out that Coldingham had a pub while St
                                            Abbs didn't. A great mixture of friendly Northern people, nice beer
                                            and good food, just what was needed after the long journey to get
                                            there. Diving for the weekend was booked with <a href="http://www.divestabbs.info">Dive St Abbs</a>&nbsp;diving from MV
                                            Topline. This proved to be an excellent large boat with plenty of
                                            room for up to 12 divers with straightforward entry and exit to and
                                            from the water via the low gunwhale. The skipper, Paul Crowe, was
                                            knowledgeable, helpful and brilliantly organised in getting divers
                                            in and out of the water and gear from the harbour wall to/from the
                                            boat despite the large tidal range. All dives were followed with
                                            piping hot coffee and chocolate biscuits.&nbsp;

                                            As there are lots of excellent 20 metre or less dive sites close
                                            to the harbour in the marine nature reserve, it's very easy to get
                                            3 dives in a day. Paul was able to suggest underwater routes that
                                            offered lots of variety including through caves, gullies, boulder
                                            fields and rock walls. St Abbs is in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.marine-reserve.co.uk/diving/introduction.htm">

                                        <p>
                                            The whole area is crammed with marine life. Underwater there is
                                            a profusion of large rocks providing loads of swim through &amp;
                                            valleys and large growths of kelp to provide shelter for wildlife.
                                            On our dives we spotted a wide variety of species, but as a
                                            relative novice I was particularly impressed by the profusion of
                                            large Ballan Wrasse, sunstars, dead man's fingers, plumose
                                            anemones, brittle stars, etc. On one dive Graham pointed out a
                                            large shoal of fish, but I thought it was a load of pollocks. On
                                            Saturday we set off for Wuddy Rocks at 9.00; back at 11.00 ish for
                                            a nice cuppa at a welcoming tea room, Spring Bank, overlooking the
                                            harbour; back out again to The Skellys at 1.00. We finished the
                                            afternoon with a shore dive to Cathedral Rock.&nbsp;

                                            Walking around the harbour walls and down the rocks fully kitted
                                            up sure brings home the advantages of diving from a boat, but an
                                            excellent dive enhanced by the leisurely tow back to shore by
                                            Graham as I had lost a fin! Walking to the pub on Saturday evening
                                            we detoured from the main road and followed a footpath next to St
                                            Andrew's Burn. Many plant species identified by Lynne, and seed
                                            heads sampled for growing on in her garden. There were some
                                            interesting sculptures dotted around, an indication of the local
                                            people's pride in their community.&nbsp;

                                            Back to the harbour on Sunday for two more dives to Black Carrs
                                            and The Skellys. To top off an excellent weekend, the traffic was
                                            free flowing on the way back, providing an easy journey home. I
                                            diligently washed all of my kit with the outside tap as soon as I
                                            got back. Just as I finished hanging it out to dry in the garden,
                                            the heavens opened and washed it all again. Normal weather service
                                            was resumed!&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                                        On the 8th of April, after a bit of effort and organisation, the
                                                        club boat was once again on its way to the coast. Our chosen
                                                        destination was Teignmouth. Saturday morning saw the compulsory
                                                        running around buying various bits for the boat, followed by a
                                                        couple of hours of tinkering to ensure the boat sea worthy. At 1.30
                                                        the boat was launched and we headed for the 15 minute ride out to
                                                        Watcombe Caves. At only 6m deep at high tide it seemed the ideal
                                                        site to give the boat its first run and a nice easy dive early in
                                                        the season.

                                                        good one. An abundance of life was there to be seen. Walls full of
                                                        Dead Man’s Fingers caught the afternoon light amongst which Jewel
                                                        Anemone could be found. Cheeky Tompot Bleany’s were having their
                                                        fun whilst Hermit Crabs scurried about. One or two Strawberry
                                                        Anemone swayed with the light current. Looking over the sand a

                                                        getting the dusty club boat finally onto the water and even got our
                                                        heads wet with two good vis dives. Taking the boat to sea with no
                                                        major hick ups was a good confidence boost for what should be a

                                                        Arriving early on Friday evening it was impossible to resist
                                                        diving on the famous Swanage Pier. With life in every corner, still
                                                        water, shallow depth and the atmosphere that comes with a night
                                                        dive it proved to be a great first sea dive for both Kevin and
                                                        Jordon. Once under the pier it soon became apparent looking at

                                                        Saturday was a nice leisurely start with a 10 minute chug out to
                                                        the wreck of the Fleur De Leys, so why did we end up diving a
                                                        rather lifeless 30 minutes at Ballard Point? Perhaps next time Tim
                                                        will keep his eye on the buoy that marked the wreck. With the
                                                        morning’s events on a somewhat choppy sea we felt it best to stick
                                                        to the shadows of the pier in the afternoon, and with 6 happy

                                                        choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                                        Heading out to the Fleur De Leys on Sunday morning with a flat
                                                        calm sea the sun on our backs and five smiley divers was a
                                                        pleasure. To actually get divers on the wreck was somewhat
                                                        mind-boggling for Tim and a little gut wrenching for Kevin. As we
                                                        ascended down the shot line the wreck appeared through the gloom
                                                        and welcomed us to the sea floor at 13 meters. My first impression,
                                                        I wish my first wreck dive had had 7 meters visibility and was as
                                                        full of life as the French fishing boat I was now looking at. Two
                                                        patrolling Bass kept a watchful eye on us as we finned around
                                                        taking in the shoals of Bib, countless crabs, shrimp and Wrasse
                                                        darting about. After 30 minutes we were back on the boat talking
                                                        about what a lovely dive we’d just had whilst at the same time
                                                        trying to avoid Kev’s breakfast which by now was arranged all over

                                                        Having introduced two divers to the English sea whilst
                                                        developing our own boat handling and dive planning skills the
                                                        weekend had been a success that was enjoyed by all. Hope to see you
                                                        all on June 9th and 10th when we shall be paying a visit to the

                                                        the shot line of the Brummer, what a great introduction to the

                                                        Lying on her port side with anchor chains still out, guns still
                                                        mounted and loads of life you can understand the attraction. That
                                                        afternoon we dived the F2 and the Barge, it’s not often you get to
                                                        dive two wrecks at once and even rarer one being sunk whilst trying
                                                        to salvage the other.&nbsp;

                                                        'Descending to 18 meters on Tuesday morning we met the Köln.
                                                        Lying on her starboard side touching the sea bed at 33 meters with
                                                        guns pointing astern she was an impressive site, with 15 meters
                                                        visibility every moment on the wreck was enjoyed. For someone like
                                                        myself who enjoys spotting as many different species as possible
                                                        whilst diving the Gobanarda Bories was a choice second dive site.
                                                        With 15 meters visibility and a ride on the S.M.B of around 5 knots
                                                        whilst decompressing this dive certainly had the thrill
                                                        factor.&nbsp;

                                                        Wednesday was a little grey and bleak which made the Kronprince
                                                        Wilhelm a touch dark at 33 meters, once under her decks the light
                                                        had all but gone. At 177 meters long this wreck is a monster and
                                                        could be dived all week before you truly knew your way around her.
                                                        In contrast the V86 was a wee bit smaller and covered in lots of
                                                        pretty sponges and Anemones with loads of fish life it meant that
                                                        every bit of the 70 minutes spent on the wreck was immensely
                                                        enjoyed.&nbsp;

                                                        On Thursday we dived the Dresden again only this time being
                                                        familiar with our surroundings helped us get a little more our
                                                        dive. The Kruha certainly won the prize for the most fish life on
                                                        one wreck, and to decompress with a huge Lionsmain jellyfish by
                                                        your side, (at half a meter across and 3 meters long maybe we
                                                        shouldn’t have been so close) well it was one to

                                                        Who’d of thought the visibility could get any better when on the
                                                        Friday morning we had 20 meters vis on the UB116, not really
                                                        recognisable as a sub but with great visibility and plenty of life
                                                        it proved to be one of the most enjoyable and relaxing dives of the
                                                        week. Dave had been a great skipper all week tending to let Gavin
                                                        his right hand man (no pun intended) drop us off at the dive sites
                                                        whilst he entertained us in deck. It was when Dave himself decided
                                                        to drop us divers of on the last dive site the S56 we realised why
                                                        this had been. Ten minutes of fining around we eventually found the
                                                        wreck Dave had been looking for. He redeemed himself once we were
                                                        on deck with fresh Mackerel cooked in butter and lemon.&nbsp;

                                                        With a belly full of Mackerel and the sighting of Porpoise and
                                                        Pilot Whales on the journey back to Burray it would have been rude
                                                        not to pop in and have a few beers with the locals. So on Saturday
                                                        morning with foggy heads and loads of diving memories to take with
                                                        us we headed of home. Would we come again? Definitely!

                                                        an&nbsp;exciting day. Setting out from Mountbatten with the sun on
                                                        our backs, not a cloud in the sky and&nbsp;the sea as flat as a

                                                        30 minutes&nbsp;later our kit was donned and we rolled over the
                                                        side of the rib to see what was lying beneath&nbsp;us. Descending
                                                        down the shot and over the bow section of the Scylla

                                                        help but get a feeling of the scale of this&nbsp;wreck, this is
                                                        helped by the fact that she sits upright on the bottom. For 20
                                                        minutes we finned&nbsp;along the sandy seabed with plenty of life
                                                        to keep us entertained. Pollock cruised past as the
                                                        odd&nbsp;cuttlefish came in for a closer look at us. Plumose
                                                        anemones and deadman's fingers are covering the&nbsp;side of the
                                                        wreck thick and fast. Inspecting the guts of the ship through the
                                                        various cut out&nbsp;sections, trying to make sense of the miles of
                                                        service pipe work that ran for miles and trying to&nbsp;work out
                                                        what was what all added to the dive. On ascending to the decks it
                                                        was possible to fin&nbsp;along gangways and look through the
                                                        hatches and doors into rooms that once saw a beehive

                                                        all as equally interesting. For some it was&nbsp;the wreck itself
                                                        with its swim throughs, passageways and being sat upright and
                                                        intact that made the&nbsp;dive so good, for me it was seeing the
                                                        life slowly taking a grip and changing the face of the&nbsp;Scylla
                                                        to conform with the way it should look now it is at rest on the

                                                        and time again and observe the modifications the sea will&nbsp;give

                                                        bottom of the ocean&nbsp;at the bow of a wreck and look up to see
                                                        the ship stretching for the sunlight is a special moment&nbsp;on a
                                                        wreck dive and where better to do it than on the James Eagan Layne.
                                                        Having waited 6 years to&nbsp;dive this wreck it didn’t disappoint
                                                        me one little bit. In contrast to the Scylla every inch of
                                                        her&nbsp;is covered in life. Dogfish were sleeping on the sandy
                                                        bottom, bib and poorman''s cod schooled&nbsp;around the wreck,
                                                        Tompot blennies happily popped out to say hello amongst the jewel
                                                        and plumose&nbsp;anemones. Lobsters were seen on more than one
                                                        occasion retreating as we shone our torches into the&nbsp;nooks and
                                                        crannies. 51 minutes on this wreck just wasn’t long enough. Some
                                                        would say with her&nbsp;structure somewhat tired she’s seen better
                                                        days but with all the history and the fascinating story&nbsp;that
                                                        comes with the James Eagan Layne I think this is a fantastic dive
                                                        with plenty of life on it&nbsp;that can be enjoyed as

                                            Islands. Diving the Lucy on Saturday, with the vis around 5 metres.
                                            Dropped down to the stern first and looked around the wheel house.
                                            Second dive was Rye Rocks where the divers had seals come up to
                                            them under the water. Sunday we dived another couple of wrecks, and
                                            on one of them we found an anchor, which we had never seen there
                                            before. Vis again was around 3 to 4 metres. We shall be diving all
                                            year round and we have places for next weekend. Tides look good and
                                            weather should settle next week ready for some good vis on the
                                            weekend. &nbsp;

                                            A great weekend of weather and diving, with sunshine and light
                                            winds. Vis not so good on Saturday with only 3 -4 metres, but much
                                            better on Sunday. Dived the Lucy with 5 metres vis and some reefs
                                            at 7 metres vis. Sunfish were spotted passing through Jack Sound
                                            and a very large seal came up to inspect the boat but as we had no
                                            fish to give him, he went across to the fishermen to see if they
                                            had any! Hen &amp; Chicks was again covered in marine life with the
                                            Trigger fish still in the same place, which they are every year.
                                            There was also a Trigger found on the Behar wreck in the Haven.

                                            Two Hard boats out Saturday diving the Lucy and High Point, with
                                            good vis at 8 metres. The Beehar was dived and there were lots of
                                            marine life on her, Dog Fish, Bib, Pollack, Wrasse, Lobsters,
                                            Spider Crabs and a nudibranch seen called Janolidae not seen before
                                            around this area, spotted by Clive who took this photograph of it.
                                            Light Bulb Sea Squirts seen in patches around the wreck, a really
                                            good dive for marine life. Vis was 8 metres.&nbsp;

                                            Lunch was in Watic Bay where we stopped for a few hours, as seen
                                            on the right, it looked like paradise and could have been anywhere
                                            in the world. Water temp 13 degrees. The Behar reef is NE of the
                                            wreck and well worth a visit, dive the wreck first then head across
                                            the shingle to the reef. The Greek wa dived later where we saw
                                            Stone Fish and some very large Spider Crabs.', 'The boilers on the
                                            wreck were most impressive with vis again at 8 metres. Some very
                                            large Lobsters were seen under the wreck, one had some berries on
                                            it, all were left behind.&nbsp;

                                            A really good day, plenty of sunshine, good company, good food
                                            (got to say that because Jan made it!).&nbsp; Sunday winds north
                                            force 5, Hard Boats left Neyland and Milford Haven. Dakotion dived
                                            on the way out to Skokholmn, vis again good at 8 metres.&nbsp;

                                            At Skokholmn there were plenty of seals about in seal bay, where
                                            we stopped for lunch. The bay had a few visitors, such as the
                                            Portuguese Man of War which we kept well clear of. They were quite
                                            small but there were hundreds of them. There were some young pups
                                            about on the rocks which we kept well clear of. Nice to see
                                            them.
